------------------------
- major overhaul of the entire underlying design:

- rewrote configuration file resolving:
    * Drupal tries to locate a configuration file that matches your domainname or uses conf.php if the former failed.  Note also that the configuration files got renamed from .conf to .php for security's sake on mal-configured Drupal sites.
- added caching support which makes Drupal extremely scalable.
- added access.module:
    * allows you to setup 'roles' (groups) and to bind a set of permissions to each group.

- added poll.module.
- added system.module:
    * moved most of the configuration options from hostname.conf to the new administration section.

drupal 2.0.0, 15/03/2001
------------------------
- rewrote the comment/discussion code:
    * comment navigation should be less confusing now.
    * additional/alternative display and order methods have been added.
    * modules can be extended with a "comment system": modules can embed the existing comment system without having to write their own, duplicate comment system.
- added sections and section manager:
    * story sections can be maintained from the administration pages.
    * story sections make the open submission more adaptive in that you can set individual post, dump and expiration thresholds for each section according to the story type and urgency level: stories in certain sections do not "expire" and might stay interesting and active as time passes by, whereas news-related stories are only considered "hot" over a short period of time.
- multiple vhosts + multiple directories:
    * you can setup multiple drupal sites on top of the same physical source tree either by using vhosts or sub-directories.
- added "user ratings" similar to SlashCode's Karma or Scoop's Mojo:
    * all rating logic is packed into a module to ease experimenting with different rating heuristics/algorithms.
- added "search infrastructure":
    * improved search page and integrated search functionality in the administration pages.
- added translation / localization / internationalization support:
    * because many people would love to see their website showing a lot less of English, and far more of their own language, drupal provides a framework to setup a multi-lingual website or to overwrite the default English text in English.
- added fine-grained user permission (or group) system:
    * users can be granted access to specific administration sections.  Example: a FAQ maintainer can be given access to maintain the FAQ and translators can be given access to the translation pages.
- added FAQ module
- changed the "open submission queue" into a (optional) module.
- various updates:
    * improved account module:
        + user accounts can be deleted.
        + added fine-grained permission support.

    * improved module module
    * improved watchdog module
    * improved database abstraction layer
    * improved themes:
        + W3C validation on a best effort basis
