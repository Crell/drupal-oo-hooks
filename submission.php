It's you judging the overall quality of a story.  But remember, vote on whether the story is interesting, not on whether you agree with it or not.  If the story goes up, you can disagree all you want, but don't vote `no' because you think the ideas expressed are wrong.  Instead, vote `no' when you think the story is plain boring.</P>";
